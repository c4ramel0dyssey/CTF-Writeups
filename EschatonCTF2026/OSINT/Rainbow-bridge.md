# Rainbow Bridge

Participants were provided with an excel file of wifi log, consisting of timestamps, SSID and RSSI (dBm). The question basically wants us to locate where this one person is currently at based on a record of his previous locations (SSID) and his wifi signal's strength (RSSI). Since this is a new form of OSINT challenge for me, it was honestly fun to do!

I didn't have any idea about RSSI at first. I looked it up and I found out that -30 dBm is a very strong signal meanwhile -70 dBm or below is a weak signal.
